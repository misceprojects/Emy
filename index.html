          <div class="story">
            <p>
              It started the way modern fate likes to start — a small swipe, a quiet spark,
              and two strangers on Bumble who somehow felt familiar.
              Then came Snapchat… and that soft, unreal feeling of
              <i>“wait… why does this feel easy?”</i>
            </p>

            <p>
              And then life happened. Silence. A long sabbatical where the world kept moving,
              and we didn’t. No noise, no updates — just a paused chapter that neither of us
              knew would continue.
            </p>

            <p>
              Until late August… when it resumed like a song you forgot you loved.
              Random texts. Small laughs. A little warmth returning.
              And then <b>September 2nd</b> — you inside your hostel, me outside,
              pretending to be calm… while you looked down from your window,
              and I felt my heart do that thing it does only around you.
            </p>

            <p>
              <b>September 3rd</b> was supposed to be simple —
              “just going to give a book” —
              but we both know it wasn’t about the book.
              It was about the car, the road, the time that didn’t matter,
              and the way we kept driving like the universe finally gave us space
              to just… be.
            </p>

            <p>
              After that came the endless series of meetups, tiny plans, sudden trips,
              and the kind of memories that don’t announce themselves while they’re happening —
              they just quietly become your favorite ones.
            </p>

            <p>
              You’ve been with me through happiness and sadness,
              and I know these last couple of months have been rough —
              things in my life pulled me down in ways I didn’t expect,
              and sometimes you felt like you couldn’t talk to me the same way anymore.
              But love isn’t only the easy days. Love is staying.
            </p>

            <p class="story-closer">
              So here’s my promise, Emy:
              we will overcome. We will come out of this.
              And one day we’ll look back and realize —
              we didn’t just survive it… <b>we emerged victorious</b>.
